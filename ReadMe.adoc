== Introduction

**GAL** language is one of the embedded scripting language designed from the ground up to directly target pass:[C++] and take advantage of modern pass:[C++] development techniques, working with the developer how they would expect it to work. Being a native pass:[C++] application, it has some advantages over existing embedded scripting languages:

. It uses a header-only approach, which makes it easy to integrate with existing projects. +
. It maintains type safety between your pass:[C++] application and the user scripts. +
. It supports a variety of pass:[C++] techniques including callbacks, overloaded functions, class methods, and stl containers. +

== Note

If you are looking for a scripting language that has always been very efficient, then GAL may not be the best choice for you. The purpose of GAL is to join the pass:[C++] coder project development in the simplest and lightest manner, reduce its development difficulty and increase the project's maintainability.

== Requirements

The GAL is written based on the pass:[C++23] standard. The code for the GAL is currently only tested on MSVC, and other compilers currently (probably) fail to compile.

== Installation

```bash
./generate_configuration.sh
```
