== Introduction

== Note

If you are looking for a scripting language that has always been very efficient, then GAL may not be the best choice for you. The purpose of GAL is to join the pass:[C++] coder project development in the simplest and lightest manner, reduce its development difficulty and increase the project's maintainability.

== Requirements

The GAL is written based on the pass:[C++23] standard. The code for the GAL is currently only tested on MSVC, and other compilers currently (probably) fail to compile.
